🌦️ Building a Real-time Weather Data Processing & Visualization 📊 🌍

Designed and implemented a real-time weather data pipeline using OpenWeather API as the data source, Apache Kafka for message streaming, PostgreSQL for data storage, and Grafana for visualization. The project ensures real-time monitoring of weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric conditions.

🔥 Project Highlights:

✅ Data Source (OpenWeather API - Producer) – Integrated OpenWeather API to fetch live weather updates for multiple cities and Developed a Python-based Kafka Producer to push real-time data into Kafka topics.
✅ Kafka Topics (Message Broker) – Configured Kafka Broker & Topics to handle real-time streaming of weather data. Ensured data partitioning for high availability and scalability.
✅ Consumer & PostgreSQL Database – Developed a Python-based Kafka Consumer to fetch messages from Kafka and Processed and inserted structured weather data into a PostgreSQL database.
✅ Grafana Visualization & Monitoring – Configured Grafana to connect with PostgreSQL as a data source, Created interactive dashboards to visualize weather trends (temperature, humidity, etc) and Enabled real-time monitoring with auto-refreshing charts.

💡 The Impact

This project transformed static weather data into a live-streaming system, providing real-time, scalable, and actionable insights through Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Grafana. By integrating automation, visualization, and reliability, the system enhances data-driven decision-making across industries. 🚀

🔍 Key Learnings from This Project:

🔹 Successfully built an end-to-end real-time data pipeline with Kafka & PostgreSQL.
🔹 Optimized consumer processing to handle high-velocity streaming data efficiently.
🔹 Designed custom Grafana dashboards to showcase weather insights in real time

Key Technologies Used: Python, Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL, Grafana, Docker, Kubernetes, Linux.
