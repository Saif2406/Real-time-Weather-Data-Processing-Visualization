# Real-time-Weather-Data-Processing-Visualization
üìç Technologies Used: Python, Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL, Grafana, Docker, Kubernetes, Linux
****Project Summary:
Designed and implemented a real-time weather data pipeline using OpenWeather API as the data source, Apache Kafka for message streaming, PostgreSQL for data storage, and Grafana for visualization. The project ensures real-time monitoring of weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric conditions.
Workflow Overview:
Data Source (OpenWeather API - Producer):

Integrated OpenWeather API to fetch live weather updates for multiple cities.
Developed a Python-based Kafka Producer to push real-time data into Kafka topics.
Kafka Topics (Message Broker):

Configured Kafka Broker & Topics to handle real-time streaming of weather data.
Ensured data partitioning for high availability and scalability.
Consumer & PostgreSQL Database:

Developed a Python-based Kafka Consumer to fetch messages from Kafka.
Processed and inserted structured weather data into a PostgreSQL database.
Implemented data integrity checks to prevent missing or duplicate records.
Grafana Visualization & Monitoring:

Configured Grafana to connect with PostgreSQL as a data source.
Created interactive dashboards to visualize weather trends (temperature, humidity, etc.).
Enabled real-time monitoring with auto-refreshing charts.

****Key Achievements:
‚úÖ Successfully built an end-to-end real-time data pipeline with Kafka & PostgreSQL.
‚úÖ Optimized consumer processing to handle high-velocity streaming data efficiently.
‚úÖ Deployed the system in a Kubernetes-based containerized environment.
‚úÖ Designed custom Grafana dashboards to showcase weather insights in real time.
